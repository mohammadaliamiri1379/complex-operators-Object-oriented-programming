# Complex Number Operations Program

This program is a C++ implementation of a complex number calculator. It allows you to perform various operations on complex numbers, including addition, multiplication, and calculating the absolute value. The program utilizes a class called `complex` to represent and manipulate complex numbers.

## Getting Started

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`, by running the command:

2. Run the compiled executable:

3. The program will prompt you to enter two complex numbers in the format `a + bi` or `a - bi`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.

4. After entering the numbers, the program will provide a menu of operations you can perform on the entered complex numbers.

## Available Operations

1. **Addition (1)**: Adds the two complex numbers together and displays the result.
2. **Multiplication (2)**: Multiplies the two complex numbers and displays the result.
3. **Absolute Value (3)**: Calculates the absolute value of each complex number and displays the results.
4. **Exit (4)**: Terminates the program.

## Example Usage

Suppose you input the following complex numbers:


The program will show the menu and ask you to choose an operation. Let's say you choose option 1 for addition. The program will then display:


You will be prompted to continue or exit. If you choose to continue, you will be presented with the menu again to select another operation or exit.

## Note

- The program assumes that complex numbers are input in the format described above, and it handles both positive and negative real and imaginary parts.
- The program uses a class called `complex` to organize and manipulate complex numbers.
- The calculations in the program are performed using the basic arithmetic operations and the `sqrt` function from the `<cmath>` library.

Please ensure you have a C++ compiler installed to compile and run the code. If you encounter any issues or errors, make sure to review and debug the code accordingly.
